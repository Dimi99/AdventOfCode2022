# AdventOfCode2022

Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. [Me](https://github.com/Dimi99) and [Anita](https://github.com/tnitn) solved it this year in C++ and Python respectively and uploaded the solutions.
